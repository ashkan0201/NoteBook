# NoteBook

Hello, I am Ashkan.
This code helps to better understand the classes.
This is the interaction code between several classes, each class doing something.

The nature of the code is that we receive some titles and comments from the user and convert the received values ​​into a dictionary.
Then we save the values ​​to a json file.

The user must be able to see the content inside the file, so we have put functions that are two modes of displaying the content inside json.
One in general and one with ID entry.
